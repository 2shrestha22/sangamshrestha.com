By default Lineage OS only supports call recording for the countries allowed by the law. But my country did not have clear policies regarding this and I was unable to submit the PR. After searching for a while I found that runtime resource overlay can be used to make this happen without needing Lineage OS to support it directly. Hence this project exists as a [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) module.
