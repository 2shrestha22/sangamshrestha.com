Yeah, I know the spelling isn't correct, but it's intentional—I’m a KDE fan and had to borrow the naming idea from it.

This is a simple package that makes adding theming to your Flutter app easy. It also supports dynamic colors, allowing your app's theme to match your wallpaper. Alternatively, you can choose any color to create a great-looking theme with minimal effort.
